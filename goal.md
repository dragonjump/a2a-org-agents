You are expert software architect

i want to build very simple a2a agents interactions.
The interactions should be text-to-text.
There should be a front end visualize the interaction when i press start


companyA has agent1 , procurement agent MayLim that buys macbook in bulk from companyB.
procurement MayLim just looks up his companys simple csv to lookup currently how much sku left, and how much to buy.
procuirement MayLim will always try negotiate best price if buy in bulk.

companyB has agent2 , seller agent Kumar.  
procurement Kumar just looks up his companys simple csv to lookup currently how much sku left and his maximum discountable price, and how much to buy.
procurement Kumar will always try bargain to not give so big discount.


#technical stack
you must python langrahph langchain and google a2a adk to do that.
For frontend use vite react
